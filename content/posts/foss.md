# What is FOSS?
   Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) is something that can completely change
the way that we view "free" things. dFOSS offers something that bigger, 
for-profit companies cannot. Since the services are open-source, they cannot
be subject to the same sins that conventionally "free" services are. For 
example, Google offers their services for free, but collect an astronomical
level of user data. By being open-source, FOSS cannot try and pull off these
tricks as users will be able to see what is happening behind the scenes.

# How Does it Work?
   Free and Open-Source Software is a topic that may confuse many. How are 
individuals able to offer software for completely free and not fall into 
the same data-collection model that other "free" services have moved to?
Here we find the true beauty of FOSS. No one is trying to monopolize anything,
yet the end product is something that rivals with, or even beats, closed-source
and proprietary software. 

# How Good is it Really?
