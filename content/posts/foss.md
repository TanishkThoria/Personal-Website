# What is FOSS?
   Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) is something that can completely change
the way that we view "free" things. FOSS offers something that our current, big
tech companies cannot. Since the services are open-source, they cannot
be subject to the same sins that conventionally "free" services are. For 
example, Google offers their services for free, but collect an astronomical
level of user data. This data is then sold, which is how Google makes money. 
But by being open-source, FOSS cannot try and pull off these tricks as users 
will be able to see what is happening behind the scenes.

# How Does it Work?
   Free and open-source software is a topic that may confuse many. How are 
individuals able to offer software for completely free and not fall into 
the same data-collection model that other "free" services have moved to?
Here we find the true beauty of FOSS. There is no attempt to monopolize anything,
yet the end product is something that rivals with, or even beats, closed-source
and proprietary software. 

   People may doubt the true quality of these softwares, as how good could 
something that is absolutely free really be? How is this financially viable? 
Well, in many cases, there tend to be companies that fund and contribute to these 
projects. However, there is still a entire community of people who are not part of 
these companies but still choose to contribute. And in that case, the contributor 
gets nothing but the satisfaction of providing FOSS to other people. 

# Is it Actually Good?

   Let us take Firefox as an example. Firefox is an open-source browser that 
takes many privacy and security precautions. It is backed by Mozilla, which 
earns its revenue through various sources, such as
